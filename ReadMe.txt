This program runs under Ubuntu 24.04 but I think it will also run under other distros as well. You need a WINKEYER by K1EL to setup your key to interface with the radio and computer.
I plugin a set of paddles and run a RCA cable from KEY1 to my radio's straight key jack. Run the program and enjoy. If you would like to make this program better or even compile a version for windows please do so.
I would like to have a Windows version of this program.

I hope you enjoy learning Morse Code as much as me, 73's
